I started a Ph.D in applied mathematics for medicine in October 2020 under the supervision of [Stéphanie Allassonnière](https://sites.google.com/site/stephanieallassonniere/home) at Université de Paris, INRIA / INSERM ([HeKA](https://team.inria.fr/heka/) team). 

I work on generative models and in particular on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to make them able to generate new data even in high dimensional low sample size regimes which are typical in healthcare. This generated data could then be used to enrich the initial training data to perform robust Data Augmentation and avoid potential over-fitting of widely used deep learning models. I also maintain Python libraries trying to democratize those models.
