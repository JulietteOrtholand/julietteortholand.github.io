WARNING THIS WEBSITE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION DO NOT CONSIDER INFORMATION

I started a Ph.D in applied mathematics for medicine in September 2021 under the supervision of [Stanley Durrleman](https://who.rocq.inria.fr/Stanley.Durrleman/) at Brain Institute, INRIA ([ARAMIS](https://www.aramislab.fr/) team). 

I work on the development of models for longitudinal data and events in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. The models could then be used for prediction and/or for the description of the pathology.
