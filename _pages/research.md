          Background: Studies showed the impact of sex and onset site (spinal or bulbar) on disease onset and survival in ALS. However, they mainly result from cross-sectional or survival analysis, and the interaction of sex and onset site on the different proxies of disease trajectory has not been fully investigated. 
Methods: We selected all patients with repeated observations in the PRO-ACT database. We divided them into four groups depending on their sex and onset site. We estimated a multivariate disease progression model, named ALS Course Map, to investigate the combined temporal changes of the four sub-scores of the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRSr), the forced vital capacity (FVC), and the body mass index (BMI). We then compared the progression rate, the estimated age at onset, and the relative progression of the outcomes across each group.
Results: We included 1,438 patients from the PRO-ACT database. They were 51% men with spinal onset, 12% men with bulbar onset, 26% women with spinal onset, and 11% women with bulbar onset. We showed a significant influence of both sex and onset site on the ALSFRSr progression. The BMI decreased 8.9 months earlier (95% CI = [3.9, 13.8]) in women than men, after correction for the onset site. Among patients with bulbar onset, FVC was impaired 2.6 months earlier (95% CI = [0.6, 4.6]) in women. 
Conclusion: Using a multivariable disease modelling approach, we showed that sex and onset site are important drivers of the progression of motor function, BMI, and FVC decline.

          The anticipation of progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is crucial for evaluations of secondary prevention measures thought to modify the disease trajectory. However, it is difficult to forecast the natural progression of AD, notably because several functions decline at different ages and different rates in different patients. We evaluate here AD Course Map, a statistical model predicting the progression of neuropsychological assessments and imaging biomarkers for a patient from current medical and radiological data at early disease stages. We tested the method on more than 96,000 cases, with a pool of more than 4,600 patients from four continents. We measured the accuracy of the method for selecting participants displaying a progression of clinical endpoints during a hypothetical trial. We show that enriching the population with the predicted progressors decreases the required sample size by 38% to 50%, depending on trial duration, outcome, and targeted disease stage, from asymptomatic individuals at risk of AD to subjects with early and mild AD. We show that the method introduces no biases regarding sex or geographic locations and is robust to missing data. It performs best at the earliest stages of disease and is therefore highly suitable for use in prevention trials.
